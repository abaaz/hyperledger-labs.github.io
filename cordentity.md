# Lab Name
Cordentity

# Short Description
Hyperledger Indy Ledger on the Corda Platform.

It is often required to share certain aspects of private data to prove
assertions based on this data. For example, a person can prove that
her age is above the legal age without disclosing how old she is. Indy
makes it possible to prove a statement is true while preserving
confidentiality. The Cordentity project integrates Indy capabilities
into a Corda-based environment.

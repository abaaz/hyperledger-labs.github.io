# Lab Name
Cordentity

# Short Description
The Cordentity project integrates Indy capabilities into the Corda platform.

Hyperledger Indy is a distributed ledger, purpose-built for decentralized identity.

Corda is a blockchain and smart contract platform. Corda allows parties to transact directly, with value. Smart contracts allow Corda to do this using complex agreements and any asset type. This capability has broad applications across industries including finance, supply chain and healthcare.

While Corda is best suited for developing decentralized applications for managing complex inter-organizational workflows, Indy is the leading open-source platform for self sovereign identity. This integration enables the development of decentralized applications on R3's best in class blockchain for business while utilizing the self-sovereign identity capabilities of Indy.

In the identity world, we are often required to prove identity assertions without necessarily wanting to reveal the underlying data. For example, an individual may need to prove that they are of a certain age without wanting to disclose their actual date of birth. Hyperledger Indy uses zero knowledge proofs to enable this functionality, allowing someone prove a statement is true while preserving confidentiality.

# Lab Name
Cordentity

# Short Description
The Cordentity project integrates Indy capabilities into the Corda platform.

While Corda is best suited for developing decentralized applications for managing complex inter-organizational workflows, Indy is the leading open-source platform for self sovereign identity. This integration enables the development of decentralized applications on R3's best in class blockchain for business while utilizing the self-sovereign identity capabilities of Indy.

# Scope of Lab
Cordentity is a self-contained CorDapp that integrates Hyperledger Indy, for decentralized identity, with the R3 Corda Platform. This project creates interoperability of two purpose-built ledger technologies, each with a focus on privacy. Corda is designed to enable private transact and Indy is a ledger built specifically for self-sovereign identity.

The combination of Indyâ€™s digital identity and the Corda platform has business applications across multiple industries. Corda provides P2P flows with flexible and configurable logic over the immutable states. Where the Indy project brings strong cryptographic instruments to operate with private data. The integrated platforms reinforce each other and allows building complicated scenarios.

In the identity world, we are often required to prove identity assertions without necessarily wanting to reveal the underlying data. For example, an individual may need to prove that they are of a certain age without wanting to disclose their actual date of birth. Hyperledger Indy uses zero knowledge proofs to enable this functionality, allowing someone prove a statement is true while preserving confidentiality.
